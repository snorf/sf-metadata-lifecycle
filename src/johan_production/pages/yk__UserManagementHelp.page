<apex:pageBlockSection >
The User Management section allows for administrators to review Users whom have YubiKeys assigned to their accounts, and provide support for lost YubiKeys, and display YubiKey status information.
</apex:pageBlockSection>

<apex:pageBlockSection >
<b>Profile:</b> The User Management section contains a table which lists all users in the Salesforce Deployment, regardless if they are assigned to a profile which has a Login Flow associated with it or not. Administrators can filter the users displayed by selecting the user profile in the profile field.
</apex:pageBlockSection>

<apex:pageBlockSection >
<b>YubiKey Status:</b> In addition to filtering the users displayed by the profile the user belongs to, users can also be filtered by the status of the YubiKey assigned to that user. Only users who have a YubiKey status matching the selected option will be displayed.
</apex:pageBlockSection>

<apex:pageBlockSection >
<b>Action: </b> The Action Column in the User Management Table contains the possible YubiKey related actions administrators can take for the user. The options displayed depend on the YubiKey Status of the user.
</apex:pageBlockSection>

<div style="margin-left: 100px;">
<apex:pageBlockSection >
<em>Assign YubiKey: </em> Clicking the Assign YubiKey action directs the administrator to a page in which they can manually assign a YubiKey to the selected user, or for users who have lost their YubiKey, allow them to self-provision a new YubiKey (if Self-Provisioning is enabled).
<br/>
To manually assign a YubiKey to the user, the administrator will need to click inside the presented field, plug the YubiKey into the computer and touch the gold button on the YubiKey. If the YubiKey is valid for Salesforce, it will be immediately associated with the user.
</apex:pageBlockSection>

<apex:pageBlockSection >
<em>Report Lost:</em> If a user reports that they have had their YubiKey lost or Stolen, an administrator can disable that YubiKey as a valid authentication device by clicking the <em>Report lost</em>. This will unassociated the YubiKey from the user, and prevent access to the userâ€™s account until a new YubiKey or Emergency Login code is issued, or self-provisioning is re-enabled..
</apex:pageBlockSection>

<apex:pageBlockSection >
<em>Generate Emergency Access Code:</em> When a user has their YubiKey reported as lost, their account is locked and cannot be accessed. To allow temporary access, administrators can use the â€œGenerate Emergency Access Codeâ€� option to generate a random 6-digit access code which can be used in place of the YubiKey generated One-Time Password for 45 minutes from the time the code was generated. Generating a new Emergency Login code will immediate invalidate any previously generated Emergency Login Code which might not yet expired..
</apex:pageBlockSection>

<apex:pageBlockSection >
<b>Name:</b> The Name of each user is displayed in the name field.
</apex:pageBlockSection>

<apex:pageBlockSection >
<b>Profile:</b> The Profile field displays the profile the user belongs to. As YubiKey Authentication must be applied separately to each profile, this field is useful in identifying which users may or may not be secured.

<div style="margin-left: 100px;">

<em>Not Assigned:</em> The user does not have a YubiKey assigned to their account. If Self-Provisioning is enabled, the user may log in with just their username and password.
</apex:pageBlockSection>

<apex:pageBlockSection >
<em>Assigned:</em> The user has a YubiKey assigned to their account. When logging into Salesforce, the user must submit a One-Time Password generated by the YubiKey assigned to them.
</apex:pageBlockSection>

<apex:pageBlockSection >
<em>Reported Lost:</em> The user has reported to their Salesforce Admin that they have lost their YubiKey. In this state, the user cannot log into Salesforce unless the administrator issues them an Emergency Login Code.
</apex:pageBlockSection>
</div>

<apex:pageBlockSection >
<b>YubiKey Serial Number:</b> The serial number of the YubiKey assigned to the userâ€™s account. This serial number will match the serial number printed on the tab of the YubiKey. The Serial number will only be displayed if the YubiKey is not reported as lost.
